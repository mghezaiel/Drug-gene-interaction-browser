Stimulation of progression from G1 to S phase allows the virus to efficiently use the cellular DNA replicating machinery to achieve viral genome replication. E1A protein has both transforming and trans-activating activities. Induces the disassembly of the E2F1 transcription factor from RB1 by direct competition for the same binding site on RB1, with subsequent transcriptional activation of E2F1-regulated S-phase genes and of the E2 region of the adenoviral genome. Release of E2F1 leads to the ARF-mediated inhibition of MDM2 and causes TP53/p53 to accumulate because it is not targeted for degradation by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination anymore. This increase in TP53, in turn, would arrest the cell proliferation and direct its death but this effect is counteracted by the viral protein E1B-55K. Inactivation of the ability of RB1 to arrest the cell cycle is critical for cellular transformation, uncontrolled cellular growth and proliferation induced by viral infection. Interaction with RBX1 and CUL1 inhibits ubiquitination of the proteins targeted by SCF(FBXW7) ubiquitin ligase complex, and may be linked to unregulated host cell proliferation. The tumorigenesis-restraining activity of E1A may be related to the disruption of the host CtBP-CtIP complex through the CtBP binding motif. Interaction with host TMEM173/STING impairs the ability of TMEM173/STING to sense cytosolic DNA and promote the production of type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta).

One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540).

Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12524540, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24652652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.","COFACTOR: Name=Zn(2+); Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:29105; Evidence={ECO:0000269|PubMed:14534297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16793544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17015838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18650397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19515728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20142040, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20364130}; Note=Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14534297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16793544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17015838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18650397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19515728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20142040, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20364130};","TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.

Acts mainly as an oncoprotein by stimulating the destruction of many host cell key regulatory proteins. E6 associates with host UBE3A/E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase, and inactivates tumor suppressors TP53 and TP73 by targeting them to the 26S proteasome for degradation. In turn, DNA damage and chromosomal instabilities increase and lead to cell proliferation and cancer development. The complex E6/E6AP targets several other substrates to degradation via the proteasome including host DLG1 or NFX1, a repressor of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The resulting increased expression of hTERT prevents the shortening of telomere length leading to cell immortalization. Other cellular targets including BAK1, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) and procaspase 8, are degraded by E6/E6AP causing inhibition of apoptosis. E6 also inhibits immune response by interacting with host IRF3 and TYK2.

Stimulation of progression from G1 to S phase allows the virus to efficiently use the cellular DNA replicating machinery to achieve viral genome replication. E1A protein has both transforming and trans-activating activities. Induces the disassembly of the E2F1 transcription factor from RB1 by direct competition for the same binding site on RB1, with subsequent transcriptional activation of E2F1-regulated S-phase genes and of the E2 region of the adenoviral genome. Release of E2F1 leads to the ARF-mediated inhibition of MDM2 and causes TP53/p53 to accumulate because it is not targeted for degradation by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination anymore. This increase in TP53, in turn, would arrest the cell proliferation and direct its death but this effect is counteracted by the viral protein E1B-55K. Inactivation of the ability of RB1 to arrest the cell cycle is critical for cellular transformation, uncontrolled cellular growth and proliferation induced by viral infection. Interaction with RBX1 and CUL1 inhibits ubiquitination of the proteins targeted by SCF(FBXW7) ubiquitin ligase complex, and may be linked to unregulated host cell proliferation.

"40","P31749","P31749","AKT1 PKB RAC","5","9606","Homo sapiens (Human)","FUNCTION: AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the TORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915). Also regulates the TORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 (PubMed:33594058). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth. AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174, PubMed:20231902). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P31750, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10576742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10926925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11994271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12176338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12964941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16139227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17726016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18507042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19592491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19934221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20086174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20231902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20471940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20682768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23431171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32228865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33594058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9829964, ECO:0000303|PubMed:11882383, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21432781, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21620960}.",NA,"TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in prostate cancer and levels increase from the normal to the malignant state (at protein level).

Displays highly oncogenic activities by corrupting the host cellular checkpoint mechanisms that guard cell division and the transcription, replication, and repair of DNA. Participates in the modulation of cellular gene expression preceeding viral DNA replication. This step involves binding to host key cell cycle regulators retinoblastoma protein RB1/pRb and TP53. Induces the disassembly of host E2F1 transcription factors from RB1, thus promoting transcriptional activation of E2F1-regulated S-phase genes. Inhibits host TP53 binding to DNA, abrogating the ability of TP53 to stimulate gene expression. Plays the role of a TFIID-associated factor (TAF) in transcription initiation for all three RNA polymerases, by stabilizing the TBP-TFIIA complex on promoters. Initiates viral DNA replication and unwinding via interactions with the viral origin of replication. Binds two adjacent sites in the SV40 origin. The replication fork movement is facilitated by Large T antigen helicase activity. Activates the transcription of viral late mRNA, through host TBP and TFIIA stabilization. Interferes with histone deacetylation mediated by HDAC1, leading to activation of transcription. May inactivate the growth-suppressing properties of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL7. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15611062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17341466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18922873, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8647434, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9632777}.; FUNCTION: Isoform 17kT antigen targets host RBL2 for degradation and promotes cell proliferation.

Stimulation of progression from G1 to S phase allows the virus to efficiently use the cellular DNA replicating machinery to achieve viral genome replication. E1A protein has both transforming and trans-activating activities. Induces the disassembly of the E2F1 transcription factor from RB1 by direct competition for the same binding site on RB1, with subsequent transcriptional activation of E2F1-regulated S-phase genes and of the E2 region of the adenoviral genome. Release of E2F1 leads to the ARF-mediated inhibition of MDM2 and causes TP53/p53 to accumulate because it is not targeted for degradation by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination anymore. This increase in TP53, in turn, would arrest the cell proliferation and direct its death but this effect is counteracted by the viral protein E1B-55K. Inactivation of the ability of RB1 to arrest the cell cycle is critical for cellular transformation, uncontrolled cellular growth and proliferation induced by viral infection.

"82","P31749","P31749","AKT1 PKB RAC","5","9606","Homo sapiens (Human)","FUNCTION: AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the TORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915). Also regulates the TORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 (PubMed:33594058). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth. AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174, PubMed:20231902). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P31750, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10576742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10926925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11994271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12176338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12964941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16139227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17726016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18507042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19592491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19934221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20086174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20231902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20471940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20682768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23431171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32228865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33594058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9829964, ECO:0000303|PubMed:11882383, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21432781, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21620960}.",NA,"TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in prostate cancer and levels increase from the normal to the malignant state (at protein level).

Stimulation of progression from G1 to S phase allows the virus to efficiently use the cellular DNA replicating machinery to achieve viral genome replication. E1A protein has both transforming and trans-activating activities. Induces the disassembly of the E2F1 transcription factor from RB1 by direct competition for the same binding site on RB1, with subsequent transcriptional activation of E2F1-regulated S-phase genes and of the E2 region of the adenoviral genome. Release of E2F1 leads to the ARF-mediated inhibition of MDM2 and causes TP53/p53 to accumulate because it is not targeted for degradation by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination anymore. This increase in TP53, in turn, would arrest the cell proliferation and direct its death but this effect is counteracted by the viral protein E1B-55K. Inactivation of the ability of RB1 to arrest the cell cycle is critical for cellular transformation, uncontrolled cellular growth and proliferation induced by viral infection. Interaction with RBX1 and CUL1 inhibits ubiquitination of the proteins targeted by SCF(FBXW7) ubiquitin ligase complex, and may be linked to unregulated host cell proliferation. The tumorigenesis-restraining activity of E1A may be related to the disruption of the host CtBP-CtIP complex through the CtBP binding motif. Interaction with host TMEM173/STING impairs the ability of TMEM173/STING to sense cytosolic DNA and promote the production of type I interferon (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta).

Acts as a more potent activator of the IFN-beta (IFNB) gene than the IFN-alpha (IFNA) gene and plays a critical role in both the early and late phases of the IFNA/B gene induction (PubMed:16846591, PubMed:16979567, PubMed:20049431). Found in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells and following viral infection, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), or toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, is phosphorylated by IKBKE and TBK1 kinases (PubMed:22394562, PubMed:25636800, PubMed:27302953). This induces a conformational change, leading to its dimerization and nuclear localization and association with CREB binding protein (CREBBP) to form dsRNA-activated factor 1 (DRAF1), a complex which activates the transcription of the type I IFN and ISG genes (PubMed:16154084, PubMed:27302953, PubMed:33440148). Can activate distinct gene expression programs in macrophages and can induce significant apoptosis in primary macrophages (PubMed:16846591). In response to Sendai virus infection, is recruited by TOMM70:HSP90AA1 to mitochondrion and forms an apoptosis complex TOMM70:HSP90AA1:IRF3:BAX inducing apoptosis (PubMed:25609812).

Acts mainly as an oncoprotein by stimulating the destruction of many host cell key regulatory proteins. E6 associates with host UBE3A/E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase, and inactivates tumor suppressors TP53 and TP73 by targeting them to the 26S proteasome for degradation. In turn, DNA damage and chromosomal instabilities increase and lead to cell proliferation and cancer development. The complex E6/E6AP targets several other substrates to degradation via the proteasome including host DLG1 or NFX1, a repressor of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The resulting increased expression of hTERT prevents the shortening of telomere length leading to cell immortalization. Other cellular targets including BAK1, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) and procaspase 8, are degraded by E6/E6AP causing inhibition of apoptosis. E6 also inhibits immune response by interacting with host IRF3 and TYK2. These interactions prevent IRF3 transcriptional activities and inhibit TYK2-mediated JAK-STAT activation by interferon alpha resulting in inhibition of the interferon signaling pathway. {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_04006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10523825, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10523853, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8598912, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9326658, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9649509}.",NA,NA,"P03126; Q12959; P52292; Q96QZ7; P33993; P49024; Q14257; Q14160; O14907; O14746; P04637; O15350-1; Q05086","Evidence at protein level",NA,"Papillomaviridae E6 protein family",NA,NA,"P03126"

In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:9840937, PubMed:24652652). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12524540, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24652652, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.","COFACTOR: Name=Zn(2+); Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:29105; Evidence={ECO:0000269|PubMed:14534297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16793544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17015838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18650397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19515728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20142040, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20364130}; Note=Binds 1 zinc ion per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14534297, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16793544, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17015838, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18650397, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19515728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20142040, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20364130};","TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Ubiquitous.

One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

Plays a role in viral genome replication by driving entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle and by autoregulating the synthesis of viral early mRNA. Displays highly oncogenic activities by corrupting the host cellular checkpoint mechanisms that guard cell division and the transcription, replication, and repair of DNA. Participates in the modulation of cellular gene expression preceeding viral DNA replication. This step involves binding to host key cell cycle regulators retinoblastoma protein RB1/pRb and TP53. Induces the disassembly of host E2F1 transcription factors from RB1, thus promoting transcriptional activation of E2F1-regulated S-phase genes. Inhibits host TP53 binding to DNA, abrogating the ability of TP53 to stimulate gene expression. Plays the role of a TFIID-associated factor (TAF) in transcription initiation for all three RNA polymerases, by stabilizing the TBP-TFIIA complex on promoters. Initiates viral DNA replication and unwinding via interactions with the viral origin of replication. Binds two adjacent sites in the SV40 origin. The replication fork movement is facilitated by Large T antigen helicase activity. Activates the transcription of viral late mRNA, through host TBP and TFIIA stabilization. Interferes with histone deacetylation mediated by HDAC1, leading to activation of transcription. May inactivate the growth-suppressing properties of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL7. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15611062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17341466, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18922873, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8647434, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9632777}.; FUNCTION: Isoform 17kT antigen targets host RBL2 for degradation and promotes cell proliferation.

Plays a role in viral genome replication by driving entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle and by autoregulating the synthesis of viral early mRNA. Displays highly oncogenic activities by corrupting the host cellular checkpoint mechanisms that guard cell division and the transcription, replication, and repair of DNA. Participates in the modulation of cellular gene expression preceeding viral DNA replication. This step involves binding to host key cell cycle regulators retinoblastoma protein RB1/pRb and TP53. Induces the disassembly of host E2F1 transcription factors from RB1, thus promoting transcriptional activation of E2F1-regulated S-phase genes. Inhibits host TP53 binding to DNA, abrogating the ability of TP53 to stimulate gene expression. Plays the role of a TFIID-associated factor (TAF) in transcription initiation for all three RNA polymerases, by stabilizing the TBP-TFIIA complex on promoters. Initiates viral DNA replication and unwinding via interactions with the viral origin of replication. Binds two adjacent sites in the SV40 origin. The replication fork movement is facilitated by Large T antigen helicase activity. Activates the transcription of viral late mRNA, through host TBP and TFIIA stabilization.

"117","P31749","P31749","AKT1 PKB RAC","5","9606","Homo sapiens (Human)","FUNCTION: AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the TORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915). Also regulates the TORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 (PubMed:33594058). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth. AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174, PubMed:20231902). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P31750, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10576742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10926925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11994271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12176338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12964941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16139227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17726016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18507042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19592491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19934221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20086174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20231902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20471940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20682768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23431171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32228865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33594058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9829964, ECO:0000303|PubMed:11882383, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21432781, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21620960}.",NA,"TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Expressed in prostate cancer and levels increase from the normal to the malignant state (at protein level).

Acts as a positive regulator of autophagy in skeletal muscle: in starved cells, enters the nucleus following dephosphorylation and binds the promoters of autophagy genes, such as GABARAP1L, MAP1LC3B and ATG12, thereby activating their expression, resulting in proteolysis of skeletal muscle proteins (By similarity). Triggers apoptosis in the absence of survival factors, including neuronal cell death upon oxidative stress (PubMed:10102273, PubMed:16751106).

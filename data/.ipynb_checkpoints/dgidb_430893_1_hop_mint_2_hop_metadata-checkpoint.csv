"5","Q04206","Q04206","RELA NFKB3","5","9606","Homo sapiens (Human)","FUNCTION: NF-kappa-B is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The heterodimeric RELA-NFKB1 complex appears to be most abundant one. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. The NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RELA-NFKB1 and RELA-REL complexes, for instance, function as transcriptional activators. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. The inhibitory effect of I-kappa-B on NF-kappa-B through retention in the cytoplasm is exerted primarily through the interaction with RELA. RELA shows a weak DNA-binding site which could contribute directly to DNA binding in the NF-kappa-B complex. Beside its activity as a direct transcriptional activator, it is also able to modulate promoters accessibility to transcription factors and thereby indirectly regulate gene expression. Associates with chromatin at the NF-kappa-B promoter region via association with DDX1. Essential for cytokine gene expression in T-cells (PubMed:15790681). The NF-kappa-B homodimeric RELA-RELA complex appears to be involved in invasin-mediated activation of IL-8 expression.

Acetylates all four core histones in nucleosomes. Histone acetylation gives an epigenetic tag for transcriptional activation (PubMed:23415232, PubMed:23934153, PubMed:8945521). Mediates cAMP-gene regulation by binding specifically to phosphorylated CREB protein. Mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-122' (H3K122ac), a modification that localizes at the surface of the histone octamer and stimulates transcription, possibly by promoting nucleosome instability. Mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-27' (H3K27ac) (PubMed:23911289). Also functions as acetyltransferase for non-histone targets, such as ALX1, HDAC1, PRMT1 or SIRT2 (PubMed:12929931, PubMed:16762839, PubMed:18722353). Acetylates 'Lys-131' of ALX1 and acts as its coactivator (PubMed:12929931). Acetylates SIRT2 and is proposed to indirectly increase the transcriptional activity of p53/TP53 through acetylation and subsequent attenuation of SIRT2 deacetylase function (PubMed:18722353). Following DNA damage, forms a stress-responsive p53/TP53 coactivator complex with JMY which mediates p53/TP53 acetylation, thereby increasing p53/TP53-dependent transcription and apoptosis (PubMed:11511361, PubMed:15448695).

Promotes cardiac myocyte enlargement. Can also mediate transcriptional repression. Acetylates FOXO1 and enhances its transcriptional activity (PubMed:15890677). Acetylates BCL6 wich disrupts its ability to recruit histone deacetylases and hinders its transcriptional repressor activity (PubMed:12402037).

Acetylates MTA1 at 'Lys-626' which is essential for its transcriptional coactivator activity (PubMed:16617102). Acetylates XBP1 isoform 2; acetylation increases protein stability of XBP1 isoform 2 and enhances its transcriptional activity (PubMed:20955178). Acetylates PCNA; acetylation promotes removal of chromatin-bound PCNA and its degradation during nucleotide excision repair (NER) (PubMed:24939902). Acetylates MEF2D (PubMed:21030595). Acetylates and stabilizes ZBTB7B protein by antagonizing ubiquitin conjugation and degradation, this mechanism may be involved in CD4/CD8 lineage differentiation (PubMed:20810990).

Acetylates RXRA and RXRG (PubMed:17761950). Acetylates isoform M2 of PKM (PKM2), promoting its homodimerization and conversion into a protein kinase (PubMed:24120661). In addition to protein acetyltransferase, can use different acyl-CoA substrates, such as (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA), butanoyl-CoA (butyryl-CoA), 2-hydroxyisobutanoyl-CoA (2-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA), lactoyl-CoA or propanoyl-CoA (propionyl-CoA), and is able to mediate protein crotonylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, lactylation or propionylation, respectively (PubMed:17267393, PubMed:25818647, PubMed:29775581, PubMed:31645732). Acts as a histone crotonyltransferase; crotonylation marks active promoters and enhancers and confers resistance to transcriptional repressors (PubMed:25818647). Histone crotonyltransferase activity is dependent on the concentration of (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA) substrate and such activity is weak when (2E)-butenoyl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA) concentration is low (PubMed:25818647). Also acts as a histone butyryltransferase; butyrylation marks active promoters (PubMed:17267393).

Also functions as acetyltransferase for non-histone targets, such as ALX1, HDAC1, PRMT1 or SIRT2 (PubMed:12929931, PubMed:16762839, PubMed:18722353). Acetylates 'Lys-131' of ALX1 and acts as its coactivator (PubMed:12929931).
